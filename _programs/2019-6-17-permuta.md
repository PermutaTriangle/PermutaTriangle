Permuta is a Python library for working with permutations and patterns.

[The newest release](https://pypi.org/project/permuta/) of Permuta is always on PyPI.
For the developmental version there is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Permuta).

After installing Permuta with

```bash
pip install permuta
```

you can define and work with permutation classes

``` python
>>> from permuta import *

>>> basis = [Perm((1, 0, 2)), Perm((1, 2, 0))]
>>> basis
[Perm((1, 0, 2)), Perm((1, 2, 0))]
>>> perm_class = Av(basis)
>>> perm_class
Av((Perm((1, 0, 2)), Perm((1, 2, 0))))
```

You can ask whether a perm belongs to the perm class:

``` python
>>> Perm((3, 2, 1, 0)) in perm_class
True
>>> Perm((0, 2, 1, 3)) in perm_class
False
```

Permuta includes the BiSC algorithm, which can conjecture a set of mesh patterns
describing a set of permutations. The easiest way to use it is to pass a True/False
property of permutations into it

``` python
>>> from permuta.bisc import *
>>> from permuta.bisc.permsets.perm_properties import West_2_stack_sortable
>>> auto_bisc(West_2_stack_sortable)
!!! Found a basis with 2 patts of length at most 4
!!! for the input using perms of length 6
