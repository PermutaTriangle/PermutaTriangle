We introduce an algorithm to determine when a sorting operation, such as
stack-sort or bubble-sort, outputs a given pattern. The algorithm provides a
new proof of the description of West-2-stack-sortable permutations, that is
permutations that are completely sorted when passed twice through a stack, in
terms of patterns. We also solve the long-standing problem of describing
West-3-stack-sortable permutations. This requires a new type of generalized
permutation pattern we call a decorated pattern.
