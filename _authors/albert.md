Michael joined the Computer Science department at Otago in December 2000. In his
previous existence as a pure mathematician he was interested in a variety of
topics, ranging from combinatorics through algebra, into model theory, with the
occasional side trip into statistics. Moving to Computer Science hasn't changed
that sort of pack rat behaviour, but his current interests are in the boundary
regions between computer science and discrete mathematics, particularly
algorithms and data structures, combinatorial computing, but especially the
[combinatorics of permutations](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/permutations.php),
and [combinatorial games](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/games.php).
