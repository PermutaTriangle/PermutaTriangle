In combinatorics, mathematicians often prove theorems by
case analysis, reduction to a smaller instance, and other "tricks of
the trade". We have developed a tool, called the CombSpecSearcher,
which automates these methods, and is able to prove results featured
in dozens of research papers. In this talk we will introduce this tool
and apply it to enumerate a particular subset of permutations of
length n.
