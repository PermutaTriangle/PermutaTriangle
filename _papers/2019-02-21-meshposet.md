We introduce the poset of mesh patterns, which generalises the permutation
pattern poset. We fully classify the mesh patterns for which the interval [1,m]
is non-pure, where 1 is the unshaded singleton mesh pattern. We present some
results on the Möbius function of the poset, and show that its value on [1,m]
is almost always zero. Finally, we introduce a class of disconnected and
non-shellable intervals by generalising the direct product operation from
permutations to mesh patterns.
