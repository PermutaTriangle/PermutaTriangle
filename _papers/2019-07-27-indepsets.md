In this  paper, we study  the staircase encoding  of permutations, which  maps a
permutation to a staircase grid with cells filled with permutations. We consider
many  cases, where  restricted to  a permutation  class, the  staircase encoding
becomes a  bijection to its image.  We describe the image  of those restrictions
using  independent sets  of graphs  weighted  with permutations.  We derive  the
generating  function  for the  independent  sets  and  then for  their  weighted
counterparts. The bijections we establish provide the enumeration of permutation
classes.  We use  our results  to uncover  some unbalanced  Wilf-equivalences of
permutation classes  and outline how  to do  random sampling in  the permutation
classes.  In particular,  we cover  the classes  Av(2314,3124) ,  Av(2413,3142),
Av(2413,3124), Av(2413,2134) and Av(2314,2143), as well as many subclasses.
