We present a way to obtain  permutation classes by inflation of independent sets
of  certain graphs.  We  cover classes  of  the form  Av(2314,  3124, P)  and
Av(2413,  3142,  P).  These  results  allow us to
enumerate a total of 48 classes, with bases containing only length 4 patterns.
Using a modified approach, we also demonstrate  a result for classes of the form
Av(2134, 2413, P) that allows us to enumerate eight more classes  described by
bases containing only length 4 patterns. We finally use our results to prove an
unbalanced  Wilf-equivalence  between  Av(2134, 2413)  and
Av(2314,  3124, 12435, 13524).
