The goal of this paper is to Wilf-classify mesh patterns of length 2. To this
end we prove The Shading Lemma, which gives sufficient conditions for two mesh
patterns to be coincident (i.e., avoided by the same permutations) and
therefore Wilf-equivalent. The lemma, along with other rules which implie
Wilf-coincidence we show that there are at most 56 Wilf-classes of mesh
patterns of length 2. We conjecture that the exact number is 46 and hope to
revisit this area and prove this conjecture.

Some of the conjectures in the paper have been proven in follow-up papers.
Specifically, the paper [Distributions of mesh patterns of short lengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07679v1),
by [Kitaev]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _authors/kitaev.md %}) and Zhang,
resolves some of the conjectures in Tables 11 and 12: They prove that the
sets of patterns \{48, 49\}, \{55 and 56\}, \{63, 64, 65\} are equidistributed, and therefore
Wilf-equivalent.

See also [Distributions of several infinite families of mesh patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00672v1),
by [Kitaev]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _authors/kitaev.md %}), Zhang and Zhang,
which proves several distribution results of mesh patterns.
