Enumerative combinatorics has traditionally been the domain of work for human
mathematicians and has been applied, for instance with the probabilistic
method, in computer science. One of the main problems in enumerative
combinatorics is the counting of combinatorial classes, and in recent years,
efforts have been made to write algorithms to solve such problems. We show that
these automated methods may benefit from the application of already mature AI
algorithms, such as Proof-Number Search.
