Tutte founded the theory of enumeration of planar maps in a series of papers in
the 1960s. Rooted non-separable planar maps are in bijection with
West-2-stack-sortable permutations, beta(1,0)-trees introduced by Cori,
Jacquard and Schaeffer in 1997, as well as a family of permutations defined by
the avoidance of two four letter patterns. In this paper we give upper and
lower bounds on the number of multiple-edge-free rooted non-separable planar
maps. We also use the bijection between rooted non-separable planar maps and a
certain class of permutations, found by Claesson, Kitaev and Steingrimsson in
2009, to show that the number of 2-faces (excluding the root-face) in a map
equals the number of occurrences of a certain mesh pattern in the permutations.
We further show that this number is also the number of nodes in the
corresponding beta(1,0)-tree that are single children with maximum label.
Finally, we give asymptotics for some of our enumerative results.
