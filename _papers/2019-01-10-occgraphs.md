We define the occurrence graph of a pattern p in a permutation as the graph
with the occurrences of p in the permutation as vertices, and edges between the
vertices if the occurrences differ by exactly one element. We then study
properties of these graphs. The main theorem in this paper is that every
hereditary property of graphs gives rise to a permutation class.

This paper started as the BSc thesis of Bjarni at the University of Iceland.
