We introduce an algorithm that produces conjectures regarding the structure of
permutation classes. These conjectures take the form of a disjoint cover of
“rules”, each of which is similar to a generalized grid class. Such a cover is
usually easily verified by a human and can often be translated directly into an
enumeration. The algorithm is successful in many cases where other algorithms
fail and is theoretically guaranteed to succeed on any polynomial permutation
class. We apply it to every non-polynomial permutation class avoiding a set of
length four patterns. The structures found by the algorithm sometimes allow
one to enumerate a permutation class with respect to permutation statistics,
and often yield a method for sampling uniformly at random from the class. We
additionally sketch a second algorithm formalizing the human verification of
the conjectured covers.
